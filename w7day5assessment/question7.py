 # Given three ints, a b c, one of them is small, one is medium and one is large.

    # Return the boolean True if the three values are evenly spaced, so the
    # difference between small and medium is the same as the difference between
    # medium and large.

    # Do not assume the ints will come to you in a reasonable order.

    # <EXAMPLES>

    # seven(2, 4, 6) → True
    # seven(4, 6, 2) → True
    # seven(4, 6, 3) → False
    # seven(4, 60, 9) → False
