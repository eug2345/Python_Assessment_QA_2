# Given two Strings of equal length, 'merge' them into one String.

    # Do this by 'zipping' the Strings together.

    # Start with the first char of the first String.
    # Then add the first char from the second String.
    # Then add the second char from the first String.
    # And so on.

    # Maintain case.

    # You will not encounter whitespace.
