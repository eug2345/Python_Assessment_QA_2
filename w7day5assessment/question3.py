# Write a function which takes an integer input, a, and returns the sum a+aa+aaa+aaaa.

# So if 2 was the input, the function should return 2+22+222+2222 which is 2468.

  # three(9) → 11106
    # three(5) → 6170

for char in "three": " three+threethree+three"
three = 9 
three = 5 
    print(three: 9)
