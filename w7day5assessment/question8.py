    # Given a string and an integer, n, return a string that removes n letters from the 'middle' of the string.


    # The string length will be at least n, and be odd when the length of the input is odd, so there will always be a 'middle'.


    # <EXAMPLES>


    # eight("Hello", 3) → "Ho"
    # eight("Chocolate", 3) → "Choate"
    # eight("Chocolate", 1) → "Choclate"
